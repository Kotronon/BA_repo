How to control the robot:

The buttons in the main menu can be selected through gaze selection. This means  look at the specific button one want to press. Then press the bumper on the controller to press the selected button.

To choose the buttons in the scene interface, one needs to point to the controller on the button one want to select and press the bumper on the controller.
The direction in which the controller is pointing is shown with a blue arrow. If the arrow hits a button, it stops there. 

To move the robody, the touchpad of the controller is needed. To move forward, they need to swipe upwards; to move backward, they need to swipe downwards. To turn rightwards, the user needs to swipe to the right and left to turn left.
